# Overview
The goal of this website is to have proof that I have passed all the learning outcomes and to document what I have learned during the past few weeks/months. 
I did this in a project manner, all of my projects follow the same structure which helps with knowing what can be found where. 

Along with that, all different products that I have been made are classified under 1 of the 5 learning outcomes, which can also be found on the webpage:
    - Conceptualize, design, and develop interactive media products ( Interactive prototypes for short )
    - Transferable production
    - Creative iterations
    - Professional standards
    - Personal leadership

# Getting started
If you want to use a part or run my website outside of the provided link, then these instructions might become helpful. While making this website, I've used a few different tools. In order to get started, please download these on top of the files that are in this gitlab:

    - VS Code
    - Google chrome
    - SCSS compiler

# Installations
VS Code and Google chrome can be easily found and downloaded by using every internet browser that is already on your PC. The SCSS compiler might give you  some trouble if there is no previous knowledge about such a thing. 

    - Open VS Code
    - Go to Extensions in the side bar
    - Search for Live Sass compiler
    - Install the Live Sass compiler by Glenn Marks

In the bottom of your work area, it now shows "watch sass" Click on this to turn it on. From now on, whenever you save the SCSS file, it will generate a CSS file to go along with it. This is the file that has to be linked in the HTML files. 

# Credits
For this portfolio, I've referenced art that has been made for the boardgame and the video game called "ROOT". All credits for these original works got to the respective artists and I in no way claim these art and/or characters as mine.
