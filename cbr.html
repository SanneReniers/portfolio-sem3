                After creating a studio, we had to choose a project that we, as a group would like to work on. We discussed this together and decided on taking on the project that Partout had briefed to us. A short briefing of this project is:
                <br><br>
                CBR would like to change their imago to be more known as a companion on the road. They want to help students pass both of their exams on the first try, and in doing this shorten the waiting lines that are troubling them a lot at the moment. 
                <br><br>
                We have to create a concept for this, and create digital and/or physical prototypes in order to test and validate this.

                <p class="cbr-reflection__iterations-paragraph paragraph">
                    During this project, I learned a lot about how to do research in a professional manner. We had 2 students that re-do the semester, and I noticed that they know a lot more about what research is needed and how to best divide these kind of tasks. This was really helpfull for me, and in the past semesters I noticed that the research front was a bit lacking on my part. 
                    <br><br>
                    I also helped with the mails that we send to the stakeholder and gave feedback them whenever we send them. I do think that we could've kept a better communication with them, which would've helped with miscommunications.

                        For the project plan, I copied over the layout that I used for my sprint X planning last semester. This helped me a lot with laying some things down, and made sure that everything that needed to be in it had a place in the document. I think that in the long run, this will really help us with keeping track of things and making sure that everything gets done. 
                        <br><br>
                        In here we have defined our main problem, our solution to this problem and the deliverables that come with this. We have divided the deliverables into 2 different columns.

                    </ul>

                    <p class="cbr-content__container-paragraph paragraph">
                        We are with too many people ( 6 ) to work on just the app with all of us, so we decided to divide the group into 2 smaller groups. 1 group for the app and 1 group for the marketing campaign. In order to make sure that both groups have some kind of coding in their project, we thought that it might be good to create a website to promote our app. This will help in the long run with getting enough things in our portfolio's. 
                        <br><br>
                        My job during this project will mostly be to help out wherever needed. I am in both of our sub-projects and will help with either advice or creating things when I am needed in one of the groups. This is follows my last reflection, where I basically said that I want to make others have a chance to learn and grow in designing things too. I'm not going to sit back and do nothing, but I want to take more of a helping and feedback type of role design wise.

                        During the time we spent on the  project, our concept changed. This also meant that the project plan had to be changed as to be in 1 line with our current concept. This new version can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="./documents/Project plan Partout CBR v2.pdf">here</a>

                        We came up with 6 different research questions and then divided those questions underneath the members of our team. The question that I got was: 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>“ How can we help teenagers get over their anxiety “</b>
                        <br><br>
                        The reason for this question is mainly that we found out that a big factor in people failing their theoretical and practical exam is due to stress and exam anxiety. One of the things that CBR wants to achieve is helping students pass their exams on the first try. Helping them overcome their anxiety is a big step into this.

                        Some of the main take-aways from this research are:

                        <li class="cbr-content__list-item">Anxiety mainly outs itself in thoughts or beliefs. They make you feel restless and/or tense and interfere with your normal day by day life. </li>

                        In order to get a bit more insight from someone that works in our field daily, we did an expert interview with a driving instructor. He owns his own driving school, and can give us a bit more insights as to what he notices with his students.

                        Doing the lotus blossom really helped us create concepts that we didn't think of before. It meant that we had to think a bit more outside of the box, and in ways that we normally wouldn't have. For me personally it was a really good exercise to just throw out ideas, and to think of ways to combine some of these afterwards. I wasn't thinking about final concepts but more of things that had to do with what was written in the middle of the block.

                        We sat together as a group, and decided what we would keep and what we didn't want to keep in our app. We originally had a lot of ideas which if we had all the time in the world, would all make it into the app. But sadly, we are working on a time-based schedule and due to this, not everything would be possible. We sat together and at first, created 2 MoSCoW templates to showcase what we thought where must haves, and what we wouldn't be doing anymore. We did this in order to help us see what we needed to work on first, and what could wait until a later moment.

                        We showed these to Dirk, and got back some feedback. This mainly led to:

Most people use something that is called Eisenhower Matrix. This works with terms like important, not important, urgent and not urgent. By doing this, it is much easier to see what is and what isn't urgent. Something can be not important, but still more urgent than something that is important.

                        I looked at the website of the ANWB to figure out what things where that we could incorporate in our concept, and if there was anything that we particularly didn't want to include. A few of the takeaways from this research are:

                        I think that by doing this, I had a clearer view of what to look out for, as well as knowing more about what was already out there, and how they did their UI/UX design.

                    While Artem and Furkan where working on the wireframes for the student side of the app, I worked on creating a wireframe that is going to be used by the instructor. This is going to look completely different then the app that is going to be used by the students, while still clearly showcasing that they belong together in terms of the color's being used. 
                    <br><br>
                    For this, I took inspiration from some the inspiration that we had already agreed upon before, this made it easier to make decisions myself, without having to consult in my team members every second. I thought about what an instructor would want when thinking about this app. I know how the student would use it, and it was then up to me to decide what would be helpful for the instructor to change the lessons based on what the student needs. This information is taken from the student side of the app, and given to the instructor so they can alter these lessons to what the student finds hard or difficult or to what a lot of the students find difficult.

                    <br><br>
                    This in turn helps the student learn in a way that feels natural to them.

                        After this feedback, I filled in the contact form on the webpage of the instructor that we had the expert interview with. Sadly, I didn't get a response on this and therefore, was not able to test it with an instructor in the end. I do think that this feedback is very good, and definitely something that I will take with me to further semesters. I do think that testing it with the correct target group is very important, and I would've loved to be able to do this for this project.

                    Eventually, we found out that the color scheme we had going worked for the logo and the dashboard, but not for the app. This made us rethink our choices and we decided that we would look into changing the colors so that it would match all 3 parts of our concept. This aligns with what I found out during my competitor analysis too.
                    <br><br>
                    We as a group tried out a bunch of different colors, but eventually settled on a white/grey/green theme which we felt like showed off the standards that we had from our studio, but also gave off the feeling that it was a place to learn, while not giving off the vibes that it was a car rental app.

                <p class="cbr-content__paragraph paragraph">
                    I created a template for the presentation, which combined some of the brandmarks from Sakura Creative with the brand that we created for Drvn. I did this by using FIGMA their presentation tool. I quite liked how this worked, and how I could add elements myself in a dynamic way, in kind of the same interface as what FIGMA uses for their prototyping canvasses. 
                    <br><br>
                    We later filled this in together, so that everyone that was presenting had the information in the presentation that they needed or wanted to have in it. 
                    <br><br>
                    I did not present myself, but instead recorded the video. For this, we used a stative that I borrowed from the media crew. This stative is created for a phone, and lets you control it in the same manner that you would a camera that is mounted on a gymball. This makes sure that the video isn't shaking. 
                </p>

                    <p class="cbr-content__container-paragraph">
                        During the presentation we got some feedback from our stakeholder and a teacher. This feedback was:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="cbr-content__list">
                        <li class="cbr-content__list-item">Use the branding of CBR, this is mainly what I am really missing at the moment.</li>
                        <li class="cbr-content__list-item">How does it contribute to reducing anxiety? Especially considering as there is an option to notify parents of their children their process. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="cbr-content__container-paragraph">
                        For the first point I've made an iteration so that it shows CBR their brand a bit more. We've thought a lot about the second point. This can work both ways. It promotes transparency, which can also reduce anxiety in students and their parents as parents can help them learn. This is why we added it in as something that a student can turn on themselves if this is wanted. 
                        <br><br>
                        Due to this and the example that Quinn gave; I do not completely agree with their second feedback point. The first point on the other hand is something that we could've thought of ourselves, we took the “You can give it a twist” a little bit too directly and this shows in our design. But, I do really like what we came up with, and I'm proud of the way we handled things as a group.

                        These retrospectives really helped me know what was going on, and what other teammembers where thinking of how we where doing as a group. It was good to get everyone their stance on certain matters, and how we could improve so that everyone feels listened to.

                While working on this project I learned a lot about working in a group, but also about the difference ways of research, and how important it is to research things well. I also learned a lot about communicating and listening to your client. I think that if we stayed in contact more with our client and asked for feedback about our design before the presentation that we would’ve had a better understanding of their wants and needs.

                I am really happy with how this project turned out, and I'm proud with what we ended up delivering. I really enjoyed working on this with my team mates and I think that that goes for almost all of us.
