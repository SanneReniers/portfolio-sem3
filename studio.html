            <p class="studio-intro__paragraph paragraph">During the first few weeks of the semester, we worked on creating a studio. We went through a few steps, in which we learned more about each other, our weaknesses and strengths and what we enjoy. We also learned who needs a bit more help in certain aspects, and discover how we can help each other in a positive way.
            <br><br>
               For me specifically, I worked on the logo and the brandbook. I am also the scrum master. Which means that I am the person that mostly manages the Monday environment, and makes sure that everything stays on track. I am also the person that divides the tasks. I find it important that each person is able to do what they enjoy or what they want to learn more about. This is something that I'm still learning, and that I will ask feedback on from my group mates.

                    In short, I learned a lot about how to work in a team while making sure that everyone can mostly do what they're good at, and how to create a planning.

            <!-- Article : Studio Content Set-up -->

            <article class="studio-content__set-up" id="studio__set-up">
                <p class="studio-content__paragraph paragraph">We started with getting together with the group, and setting up some ground rules. This was an important first step, as it makes sure that everyone is on 1 line. I think that for me personally, it was very nice to see that this was also something that my group mates wanted, as I feel like by doing this, we can hold people accountable if they are regularly not there, or just not doing what we agreed upon. During this time, we also talked about what people where good at, and what parts of the project they could lead.</p>
                <p class="studio-content__paragraph paragraph">We assigned roles, in which I took the role of “Designer”. This means that during the projects we will be doing this semester, I will be the one responsible for making sure the design of the project is done, but also to give feedback on people when someone else is doing apart of this task. If someone is stuck, then I am the person that they will go to. I find this quite a challenge, as I sometimes find it a little bit hard to give people feedback. I'm scared that this hurts someone, and that is the last thing that I want to do. This is something that I want to learn, and I think that this is a good opportunity for this. (<span><img class="learning-outcome__icon lo-img" src="./images/learning-outcomes__personal-leadership.png" title="Personal leadership"></span>)</p>
                <p class="studio-content__paragraph paragraph">We had a presentation about the scrum method, and as a group decided that we wanted to use this method in combination with Monday. This is also where I took on the role of scrum master along with the designer role that I already had. We set it up in such a way, that everyone could easily see what their tasks are, and what story and epic they fall under. I think that by doing this, we make it easier for people to understand what their task is, but also to keep a grasp on what is done, what is being worked on and what still needs to be done this sprint. I really liked doing it this way, and I think that this will be something that I want to keep using and doing in the following semester.

                <p class="studio-content__paragraph paragraph">The next main part of the project, was creating a logo. We decided that we would all create a few sketches, and that we'd go from there. I started thinking of how I could combine what we do, so creating websites and branding means, in combination with the Sakura blossom. In doing this, I created something that was quite simplistic, and not immediately recognisable. But once people recognised it, they quite liked what I did.
                    <br><br>
                    We talked to a teacher, and showed the logo's we as a group liked best. This included some of mine, but also included some that my group made. There where a few points that really set us thinking. (<span><img class="learning-outcome__icon lo-img" src="./images/outcomes__creative-iterations.png" title="Creative iterations"></span>)</p>

                    <p class="studio-content__image-description paragraph">First logo sketches by me</p>
                </div>

                <div class="studio-content__container">
                    <ul class="studio-content__list paragraph">
                        <li class="studio-content__list-item">Avoid complex looking logo's. It is important to make sure that detail and meaning is not lost when resizing the logo.</li>
                        <li class="studio-content__list-item" >Make sure that the logo is usable in different instances. For example: on a business card, as a favicon, Instagram profile picture etc.</li>
                        <li class="studio-content__list-item" >Think about what you want to achieve as a studio and try to incorporate this in the logo.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="studio-content__container-paragraph paragraph">After this feedback, we moved on with the first sketch of the logo that one of my group mates made. We liked the initial thought of this, but it was just too detailed in the beginning. I took this as a starting point and simplified the design so that it used just some basic shapes.</p>

                    <p class="studio-content__paragraph-full-width">We talked about this, and liked the direction where it was going. But it wasn't quite there yet. I looked at some pictures of the Sakura tree, and noticed that it wasn't just some blossoms, but that it was closer to resembling an actual tree, but then with pink colours. I took this as the initiative to create a new version, with the tree being in full bloom. This stands for our process, and how we help businesses bloom with the best version of themselves.
                        <br><br>
                        We decided that we liked it the most without the mountain, as this went a bit against our brand identity. I asked for feedback from one of our teachers and got a very positive review back. There where a few points that we iterated on from this point on:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="studio-content__list">
                        <li class="studio-content__list-item">In Japanese style it is very common to see the use of brush strokes, try to experiment with this.</li>
                        <li class="studio-content__list-item">The tree looks nice like this, but it might be nice to add some leaves falling off to visualise that time is passing, and that this can be beneficial to growing up to be better.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="studio-content__paragraph-full-width">We ended up with the following version: (<span><img class="learning-outcome__icon lo-img" src="./images/outcomes__creative-iterations.png" title="Creative iterations"></span>)</p>

                    <p class="studio-content__paragraph-full-width paragraph">At first, we agreed that this would be our final logo. But, during our midway presentation we got some more feedback from both Dirk and Stan that made us change a small detail in our logo.</p>
                    <ul class="studio-content__list">
                        <li class="studio-content__list-item paragraph">Stan mentioned that the final logo looks a bit feminine where the sketch originally does not showcase this. Try to find a balance between the two.</li>
                        <li class="studio-content__list-item paragraph">Dirk did not agree with this and mentioned that where it looked a bit feminine, it also showcased balance and he really liked that.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="studio-content__paragraph-full-width paragraph">To get into a bit of a middle way between this I used a new font that I found during the exercise earlier that class. The font is called “Protest Revolution” and it looks a bit like a brush stroke. I feel like this really fits with the whole Japanese style.

                </div>

                <p class="studio-content__paragraph paragraph">In the end, we ended up with a design that I am very proud of. We created a few variations of this to be used in a variety of different ways, and in 2 different colours so that we could also use it on a darker background. Looking back on this part of the project, I think that I learned a lot in terms of how to take inspiration from something that wasn't originally a logo. I also found it really interesting to be able to include a different culture in my design and to see what Japanese style looks like and how western society uses and views it.

                <p class="studio-content__paragraph-full-width paragraph">When we first started the brandbook, we used a lot of white and black without any accent colours. I worked on this along with another group mate of mine, but we divided the pages. Therefore, I can easily write about what part of the brandbook I made and which parts aren't mine.
                    <br><br>
                    Our Lo-Fi brandbook included just black and white, and wasn't very special. We did have some inspiration pictures that we found on Behance and Dribbble.

                    <p class="studio-content__container-paragraph">We talked about the feedback we got, and together we came to the conclusion that we really liked that the title pages stood out from the rest.

                        Together we created a lot of different pages with different colour palettes so we could try to figure out what we wanted to use. We decided that we liked the purple one the most, as it created a really nice contrast between the white and the purple.
                        <br><br>
                        During the final presentation, we got some feedback from Dirk on our brandbook which is the cause of us changing it again. It was just a minimal change, but it was something that I hadn't thought about before.

                <p class="studio-content__paragraph-full-width paragraph">In the end, we ended up changing the colour of the brandbook. This wasn't something that I did, So I won't be going into this a lot.
                    <br><br>
                    I am very proud of the way the brand book ended up looking, and I think that the way it looks now really fits our brand. Teamwork wise, I learned a lot in terms of working together on 1 product. I had never done this before, and it came more naturally then I expected. I really liked working on this with more people as it divided the work better, and in a more optimal way.

                        We decided that we would all create some iterations on the feedback that we got the past few days, and that we would go and finalise the design from there. I created the following versions based on the feedback above, which is also a part of how we got to the final design. The final design we settled on is the version I made, but with some different artwork in the vertical square.

                        <br><br>
                        I think that overall, we created something that I am very happy with. I think that our teamwork in this part of the project was very good, and I am happy with how it went. I think that for me personally, I need to make sure that with the next project someone else also has a chance to do the branding. For the logo and the website the final designs that I did where chosen and this doesn't feel completely fair to my team mates. I know that we choose them together, but I want them to have a chance too. I think that my goal for the next project will be to take a slight step back from the designing of the branding products, but to give them feedback and help wherever I can without completely taking over.

                <p class="studio-content__paragraph paragraph">The final part of this project, was to create a retrospective so that we could look back upon the past few weeks and discuss what went well, what didn't go well or what we want to add into our way of working. I think it was really good to sit together with everyone and do this and it helps establish agreements, but also makes sure that there is a set time for everyone to discuss the things they want to improve on, but also to make sure that everything goes well and that everyone feels good about the things we are doing as a group.

                    <br><br>
                    I created notes about this meeting, and I think that the things we discussed really helped us to create a better team environment but also made sure that we are all on the same page.
                    <br><br>
                    The main thing that was the most important for me was that we will all be there on time. In the past few weeks it happened quite regularly that 1 or 2 people where not there at the agreed upon time. While this can happen sometimes, it is quite annoying when this happens every single day. This is something that I think it's important to work on over the next sprint.

            <p class="studio__overall-reflection__paragraph paragraph">
                I think that overall, the past sprint went really well. I got to know my group members a bit better, but also just had a really good time working on products and getting better at designing things in a group. I think that the main thing that I need to work on next sprint is to also give other people a chance at designing something. I can give feedback, but I think that it is important to give them the time and space to design things themselves and to figure these things out on their own. Some parts I already figured out in the past 5 years, but they don’t have that experience yet. I want to take a step back from designing, and work a bit more on the coding aspect of things when possible.
